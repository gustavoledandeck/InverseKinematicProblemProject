# InverseKinematicProblemProject
Hello, how are you? This project is build up with academic purpose to study the Inverse Kinematic problem in a Robotic Arm. In this project, it is reduced to a 3-DOF approach. In the future, me and my mentor will extend it to a 4-DOF and 6-DOF problem. Feel free to help us, comment and share it. Have fun!
